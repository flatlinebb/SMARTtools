# SMARTtools

One-liner scripts, designed to simplify running SMART checks on hard drives, using the smartctl utility.

You can start a short test on all detected (SATA) drives, with `smart-test-short-start.sh`.

To check the status of the short test, use `smart-test-status-all.sh`.

To constantly monitor the test progress, using watch, use `watch-smart-test-status.sh`.
